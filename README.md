# Anasa
[Anasa](https://anasa-rh.herokuapp.com/) is an Asana Clone for educational purposes demonstrating User Authentication, CRUD for Projects, Tasks, and Teams built using PostgreSQL Ruby on Rails backend and React-Redux frontend.

Anasa is a website designed to help users keep track of the status and deadlines of tasks and projects -- especially in teams when communication is key. With using Anasa, team members can see who is responsible for each task, the deadline of the task, and the status of the task.
